# EquityModel

Thank you for taking the time to examine my Equity Model. You can run the model by clicking the button below labeled 'launch binder.' This link will take you to a binder page which may take a few moments to load. It will look as though there is code running on a black screen, which signifies the binder is working correctly and will be taking you to a docker with the executable code shortly. After the binder is done executing, you will be sent to a Jupyter page. You can toggle between the 'By_Identifier' and 'Full_Model' code and execute each based on the written directions to produce the desired model. Enjoy!
